;;; To run the credit assessment example, evaluate the contnts of this file, 
;;; then, build a tree and bind it to the variable *tree* by evaluating:
;;;
;;; (setq *tree* (build-tree credit-examples))
;;;
;;; using this tree, you can classify instances.  E.g.
;;;
;;; (classify '((history . good) (debt . low) (collateral . none) (income . 15k-to-35k)) 
;;;            *tree*)
